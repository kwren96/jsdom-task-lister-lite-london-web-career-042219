## Deliverables:

- A delete function that will remove tasks from your list
- A priority value selected from a dropdown that is used to determine the color of the text in the list (e.g. red for high priority, yellow for medium, green for low)
  - As a challenge, implement a sorting functionality that displays the tasks ASC/DESC based on priority
- An additional input field (e.g. user, duration, date due)
- Ability to edit tasks
- Something of your choice! The main objective is to add a feature that allows the user's input to affect the DOM
